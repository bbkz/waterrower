- allow starting webinterface without serial connection (for archive viewing) -> create event / state?
- overwrite workouts.json in nextcloud upload
- when starting workout from s4 -> get the data/settings
- exit button
- less command line -> start as service with webinterface -> requires running without serial con
- better layout -> wip
- font graph -> wip
- disable fit upload in demo mode? -> demo can have different config file
- migrate google fit into storage.py alongside with the nextcloud uploader -> need google fit (maybe with anbox - https://www.linuxuprising.com/2018/07/anbox-how-to-install-google-play-store.html ?)
- test running the server with a user that has serial dev permissions (dialout group)
